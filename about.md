### What is Markdown?

According to John Gruber of [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) Markdown is:

> a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

HTML is great for presenting the information for the web. But, writing HTML in that nice format is not simple and easy without some tools and real understanding of the HTML (the markup language) with its rules and syntax.

Markdown, unlike HTML, is meant for anyone to write with a simple editor without an understanding many rules and syntax of the HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext **Markup** Language. Since it is a Markup, the Markdown got its opposite name: Markdown.
