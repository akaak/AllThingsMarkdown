Markdown is nothing but simple text plus some formatting within the text to allow for formatting for the websites. 

Since it is simple text, one could use a `notebook` or text editor vs a Document formatting software such as Microsoft Word, HTML editors, or others to formatting the documents.

Example text in Markdown:

   `A link to the *Wikipedia* [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) about the **Markdown**`

The same text Formatted in HTML:

> A link to the *Wikipedia* [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) about the **Markdown**.


As you can see the text Wikipedia is in italics because of an asterisk (*) before and after the word. Website link is in parenthesis whereas the link text is in square brackets. The work Markdown is Bold because it is surrounded by two asterisks (**).

That's it!
